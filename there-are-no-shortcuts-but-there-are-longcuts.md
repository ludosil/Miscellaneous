Think about a recent project you worked on. How long did it take from start to finish? If you had to do it again, knowing what you do now, how long would it take you?

My own experience is that a project lasting six months to a year could be undertaken, with the benefit of hindsight, in less than two months. There’s no magic here; when you have a clear idea of what you want to do, it doesn’t take that long!

‘Longcuts’ arise from a number of sources, including:

- not understanding what stakeholders want/need
- stakeholders not understanding what stakeholders want/need
- poor design
- developing code with ‘lock-in’
- testing late

You’ll never have perfect foresight — requirements and resources can change without warning — but for the most part longcuts can be avoided by having the relevant conversations and design decisions upfront:

- actively engage stakeholders to really understand what they need vs. what they don’t need (just as important); your perspective as a developer can help to draw out a clear set of requirements
- keep the design modular with a ‘what if things change?’ perspective
- test from the start, ideally with an automated framework that you can build on and leverage for the remainder of the project
- ask others to review your design; there’s no one right way to do it and it’s always useful to get the perspective of others
