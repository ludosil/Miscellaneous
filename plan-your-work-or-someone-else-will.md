When you're coding it's often as part of a project. As such, there is likely to be some layer of project management that sits on top of the development that is concerned with engaging stakeholders to understand what needs to be done (aka requirements), and planning the work to achieve that goal.

The type and style of project management depends on the scale of the project, and also the culture & preference of the organisation. Small teams and/or small companies tend to favour a light-touch approach, whereas bigger projects are increasingly managed with an agile approach.

In either case, it's useful to develop a personal plan for your work. It doesn't need to be complex, and it can be as simple as items in Notepad, Excel or Outlook. The plan should demonstrate that:

- you have a clear view on what you are doing over a given timeline;
- you can link what you are doing to a given requirement of the project;
- you undestand which items are to be prioritised;
- you have estimated how long a given piece of work will take, acknowledging the uncertainty;
- you understand how this work overlaps with others, for example if what you are doing is a pre-requisite to someone else in the project starting a piece of work;
- you can break down a given piece of work into steps.

This isn't necessarily a comprehensive list. What is important is that you demonstrate ownership over your own work, and that you understand how that work fits into the project. This type of personal plan isn't essential; you can work within a project and allow others to delegeate. However, the extent to which you can do this, is the extent to which you maintain personal autonomy within a project.
