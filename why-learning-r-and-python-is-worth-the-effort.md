**They're intuitive and you write less code**

Given the choice, would you prefer a model to have 100 lines of code, or 1000? Less code to achieve the same outcome is easier to maintain and more robust. Python and R are high-level languages that allow you to express high-level concepts intuitively and succinctly.

**They're free**

Proprietary software isn't cheap. Python and R are free.

**They're fast (enough)**

Stochastic models often need to run thousands or perhaps millions of simulations. Models in Python and R scale well; rarely do you need to start a model run on Friday night to complete over the weekend. There are of course limits to how fast models can be, but for actuarial purposes this is typically not a constraint.

**Code in different styles**

Python and R are general-purpose languages that allow a variety of styles, including: imperative programming, functional programming and object-oriented programming. You can code how you want to code.

**Usually someone else has done what you want to do**

Python and R are supported by thousands of libraries developed by the community. Whatever you need to code, the chances are that someone else has already done it. 

**Array calculations**

Most actuarial models are framed in terms of dimensions. For example a model to project annuity cashflows may have the dimensions of policyholder x projection time. If the model is stochastic, there would be an additional third simulation dimension. With Python and R we can easily represent such arrays, and perform calculations on the arrays themselves. Say goodbye to (the majority of) for loops.

**Data-frames**

Tabular data, typically held in CSV files, is easily read in and represented as data-frames in Python and R.

**Notebooks**

Well-written models have a narrative; there is a clear distinction between inputs, calculations, outputs, and analysis. Traditionally there is limited scope for a user to interact with a model, other than to push the go button and await the results. Notebooks enable an interactive experience more akin to Excel.

**UIs**

Python and R are easy to integrate with user interface (UI) frameworks, for example RShiny (for R) and Dash (for Python). The UI frameworks are designed to be simple and intuitive to set up; you don't need to be a software developer.
